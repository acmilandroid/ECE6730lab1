Before running this program on the Palmetto machines, the following
command must be run first:

module purge
module add gcc/4.8.1
module add openmpi/1.8..1

These command ensure that the right compiler and MPI executeable
are generated when attempting to run this program.

To run this program, the program must first be compiled using the
command:

mpicc -g -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -o smallball ./smallball.c

After this command has been run, you can run the program either
using the mpiexec command like so:

mpiexec -n 4 ./smallball

Alternatively, on the Palmetto machines, you can queue the task
to be run using a .pbs file and the following commands:

export PBS_O_WORKDIR=/home/basill/smallball
qsub smallball.pbs

Of course, the export command should be edited accordingly to set
the correct output directory. After running these commands, the
Palmetto machine will output a file names smallball.oXX, where XX
is some number. This will contain the output contents of the
executed program.

It is important to note that while the program may run correctly,
passing the ball from process 0 to n number of processes before
returning the ball back to process 0, the printing may not follow
the order of the ball being passed, so the output may look more
or less out of order.
